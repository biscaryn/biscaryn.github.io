<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I am currently working as Chief of Staff at <a href="https://lattice.xyz" target="_blank">Lattice</a></strong>. We are building and enabling others (via the open-source <a href="https://mud.dev" target="_blank">MUD</a> framework) to build large, complex, and most importantly, <strong>playful Ethereum applications</strong>, like a <a href="https://dev.optimism.io/opcraft-autonomous-world/" target="_blank">fully on-chain Minecraft</a> whose rules and entities live entirely on Ethereum, or an <a href="words3.xyz">infinite Scrabble</a> where letters can be bought at a VRGDA-adjusted price</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I devote most of my spare time to music</strong>, from playing the piano to composing my own music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in Linguistics</strong>, focusing mainly on syntax and computational linguistics, with my dissertation written on <a href="https://jayyeung.com/resources/Jay_dissertation.pdf" target="_blank">improving synthetic speech intelligibility</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-current-projects">ðŸŽµ Current projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am currently <strong>composing the soundtrack to a video game</strong> due to launch later this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Lattice, I am a generalist working across many topics, from partnerships to product, community to legal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-past-experience">ðŸ“œ Past experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I worked as a strategy consultant at <a href="https://bcg.com" target="_blank">Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</a></strong>. I mostly worked on <strong>commercial due dilligence projects</strong>, helping clients decide whether to buy a company by learning as much as possible about the company and industry in 2-4 weeks. Some weird industries that I now know a strange amount about include fridges for drugs and the distribution of nails, screws, and sandpaper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I founded and sold <a href="https://tomorrowsci.com" target="_blank">Tomorrow Science</a></strong>, a Chinese language popular science website that had 140,000+ followers on social media, 300,000+ monthly page views, and 5 employees. The goal of Tomorrow Science was to help readers envision the world of tomorrow through the latest scientific, technological, and medical news. In May 2020, Tomorrow Science was sold to 2 Taiwanese investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I founded <a href="https://clearcall.app" target="_blank">Clearcall</a> with Justin Glibert and Florian MÃ¼ller</strong>, which won the <a href="https://pioneer.app" target="_blank">Pioneer tournament</a> and became a profitbale SaaS business.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-fun-things-about-me">â›„ Fun things about me</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I never went to high school.</strong> When I was 12 years old, I left my native Hong Kong and spent 2 years at Plum Village, a Zen Buddhist monastery in France, to study under Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh. Changing my mind last-minute about becoming a monk, I spent my pre-university years studying French and Spanish at language schools in Lyon, Barcelona, and Salamanca.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I can speak 5 languages</strong>. As a result of my pre-university journey, I can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Spanish fluently and French at an intermediate level. I self studied for the British A-levels and ultimately chose to study linguistics at Edinburgh University.</p>
</li>
